Pypeline
========

Pypeline is designed to simplify the creation and management of large data.
It has a friendly and easy-to-master API backed by the power of `LevelDB
<https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/>`_.  This allows it to manage datasets too
large to fit in RAM without sacrificing data access performance.

Pypeline is great for:

* Exploring datasets without eating all your RAM
* Transforming data with maps, filters and reductions
* Stopping you from losing or overwriting your data (unless you explicitly ask it to)

It's also super easy to export a dataset from Pypeline to Pandas for further
analysis.
