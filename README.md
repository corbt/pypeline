Pypeline DB
===========

Pypeline DB is designed to simplify the creation and management of datasets. It
has a friendly and easy-to-master API backed by the power of
[LevelDB](https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/).  This allows it to manage
datasets too large to fit in RAM without sacrificing data access performance.

Pypeline is great for:

* Exploring data without eating all your RAM
* Transforming data with maps, filters and reductions
* Stopping you from losing or overwriting your data (unless you explicitly ask it to)

It's also easy to export a dataset from Pypeline to Pandas for further
analysis.
